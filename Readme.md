# Full-Stack Chat Room Application

## Overview
My experience spans both front-end and back-end development. Notably, I built a full-stack chat room application using:
- **MongoDB**  
- **Node.js**  
- **Express**  
- **React**  
- **WebSockets** for real-time communication  

Additionally, I utilized **Docker** for both development and production environments, deploying the application on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to enable scalability for both the front-end and back-end.

## Running the Application

### Using a Virtual Environment
1. Create a virtual environment (`venv`).
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
