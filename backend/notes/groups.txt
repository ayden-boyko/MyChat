groups will have profiles of the following format

GROUP
group_num: int
group_name: string (this is their name associated with the group)
group_profile: Image (MAYBE?????)
members: [id] or {username : id} (im opting for arrays for performance reasons, the names can be displayed based off of ids)
chat: {member_id : message} x50
SHOULD GROUPS HAVE A CHAT HISTORY? I THINK IT SHOULD LIKE DISCORD
