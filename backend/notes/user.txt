users will have profiles of the following format
USER
user_num: int
name: string (this is their name associated with gmail)
username: string (their name as it appears to other users)
password: HASHED PASSWORD (unhashed and compared to submitted password)
user_profile: Image
friends: [id] or {username : id} (im opting for arrays for performance reasons, the names can be displayed based off of ids)
blocked: Same as friends but for blocked users
groups: Same as friends but for groups

For friends, storing ids and names would result in less backend calls for rendering results, 
the names wouldn't have to be retrieved but this would result in larger amounts of user profile data

MUST WEIGH THE PROS AND CONS OF EITHER OPTION

WILL GROUPS HAVE THIER OWN DATA STRUCTER WITHIN MONGO????
